# Reconnect wifi and reload firefox's latest tab

# Reconnect wifi
wifi

# Sending Firefox the reload command, CTRL+R
xdotool search --desktop 3 --class "Firefox" key --clearmodifiers "CTRL+R"
# Here, --desktop 3 is necessary without which xdotools was unable to activate
# The Number 3 is because firefox is located in the 4th taglist in awesome window manager. The count goes from 0,1,2,3,4,.. etc
# You can find the desktop number using: xprop | grep WM_DESKTOP
# and then clicking on the window with mouse
# Observation: this --desktop 3 is not needed at all, it automatically searches for all windows with --class "Firefox" and finds it.

# Activating the firefox window
xdotool search --desktop 3 --class "Firefox" windowactivate
