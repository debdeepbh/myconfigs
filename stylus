xinput gives the list of devices.

Device: Stylus

Button 1: touch the pen on the screen
Button 2: the upper button
Note: The lower button is not a part of the stylus

all the devices show that they have 7 buttons. Probably formal. Not changeable. 

Bug: Bring stylus close to the screen, hold button 2 on stylus, move it out of the screen, release button. Not bring the stylus close to the screen. An automatic Button 2 click is detected. It continues for several times unless you disable and enable the device (xinput disable 12, xinput enable 12)

Device: Eraser

This device gets activated when the lower button is pressed.
Button 1: touch the tip to the screen (while holding the lower button)
Button 2: ?

It seems that the glitch with button 2 is gone if I disable Hover click property of the stylus in xinput:

xinput set-prop "Wacom Hover Click" 0

Add it to .bashrc along with other calibration options.

Surprisingly, "Wacom Enable Touch" value does not affect the ability to use touchscreen alongside stylus.
